Exercise 16 â€“ Object Orientation

Objective:

* To experiment with classes and objects
* To design an inheritance hierarchy
* To learn about encapsulation and polymorphism

Task A: Create a Person inheritance hierarchy

Design at least 3 classes: Person, Employee and Customer
Consider appropriate constructors, properties and methods for these classes
Demonstrate your understanding of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
Create a client script and instantiate objects based on the above classes and call their methods and set their properties to demonstrate working functionality.

Task B: Create an Account inheritance hierarchy

As above, design a separate hierarchy for Bank Account types and a client script to demonstrate functionality.
NOTE: Organise your code into different files and use meaningful names for all attributes and methods.
